2018-09-14 12:41:09 25724  [WARNING] Warning: One or more nets are completely unrouted.  Do you want to connect them using "virtual", Manhattan-style routing?  (Does not apply to power-supply nets.)  Note: This process will begin by determining the detailed routing status of every net on the board, which can be very time-consuming (especially if some power-supply nets are mistakenly identified as signal nets).  If you prefer to skip this process now, you can run it later using Edit > Connect Nets with Manhattan Routing. - The "No" button was selected
